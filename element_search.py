# Write a function that takes an ordered list of numbers (a list where the elements are in order from smallest to
# largest) and another number. The function decides whether or not the given number is inside the list and returns
# (then prints) an appropriate boolean.
#

numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,]

for i in numbers:
    if i in numbers:
        print("True")
